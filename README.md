*** Classification for a Customer Feedback Company***

The purpose of this project is to implement a classification for customers, who have answered the questionnaires of the Customer Feedback Company, and to identify if they would buy again in the future from the certain shop or not. Moreover, we examine the reasons that had a significant impact on the customers' decisions. 

The companies under examination, referred to two Super Makret chains and two Technology Stores chains and the datasets included data for the periods of Jyly - September 2020 and October - December 2020 for each company. 

For more detailed insights, we conducted a seasonality analysis, which included the periods Before Quarantine, During Quarantine, Black Friday, and Christmas/Click-away period.
